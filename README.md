# Multi_Agent_Research_Assistant

This project is an CrewAI-powered assistant that reads recent research papers from the internet, especially from arXiv. It uses multiple AI agents that work together â€” one searches for the latest papers, another reads and understands them, and a third writes a clear summary like a blog post. The result is an easy-to-understand summary of complex research, written as if by a helpful science expert. The project notebook was run on Google Colab.
